The most dominant dynamics of a refridgeration container/trailer are thermal dynamics of the metal in heat exchangers (i.e. evaporator and condensor). Some components in the system will have dynamics so much faster than the dominant dynamics that they will be considered static (compressor and expansion valves).
In the end the model will be composed of a model that represents the refridgeration cycle along with a model of the thermal masses (in heat exchangers, other metal parts and cargo)
