This project documents the modelling and MIMO controller design of a reefer trailer. A non-linear model constructed from individual component models for all components in the system. A linearisation is made at an operating point, Kalman decomposition,  

The project is made in collaboration with BITZER which has supplied a Hi-Fi simulation to test on and lent extensive counselling during the project.
