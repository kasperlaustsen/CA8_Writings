A simple pole-placement method controller will be made as an initial step to make sure that the model is sufficient and to get a feel for system before moving on to a more complex controller. An MPC controller is chosen due to its ability to handle constraints which is essential for handling the actuator limitations in a reefer system. Both controllers will be benchmarked against
