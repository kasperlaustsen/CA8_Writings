\begin{frame}{Future work}
	 \textbf{System model}
	 \begin{itemize}
	 	\item Continued work on component model analysis
	 	\item Improvement of connection between components
	 	\item Inclusion of all controlled variables in the model
	 	\item Increased number of relevant states
	 \end{itemize}
 
 \bigskip
 
 	\textbf{Controller design}
	\begin{itemize}
 		\item Integral action for no steady state error
 		\item MPC design for inclusion of actuator constraints
 		\item Gain scheduling for wider range of control
 	\end{itemize}
